# LaTeX template example (with BCU Harvard style referencing capabilities)
This template is the same one I used for my dissertation. But it can be used to construct any thesis or report for other modules as well.

It was originally based on Mihai's LaTeX template (available at: https://github.com/MihaiNastase/LaTex-Starting-Template), but I have modified various aspects to make it more suitable (e.g., added additional packages for more features, altered the referencing style, added a bibliography part, added dynamic table widths, altered the layout and spacing, etc.).

The main reason I wanted to make this available is because many parts took a lot of Googling and time to figure out and/or discover. So, hopefully this can help resolve some blockers or issues without excessive Googling.

For those new to LaTeX, I recommend to check out the basic official guides first (available at: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes), then check out this template.
